# A Simple Password Generator Built In React

This is my first solo React Project - A simple Password generator.

You can try the project here: https://0x978.github.io/Password_Generator/

I attempted this without following any guide, so It's likely to be imperfect

However, I would consider this feature-complete, although I may revisit some of the CSS once my CSS skills improve.

## Features:
- (Pseudo)Random password generation using Javascript
- Automatic copying to user clipboard

## Technologies Used:
- React
- Github Pages
- CSS
- HTML
